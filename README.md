# AwesomeTanks
Android and desktop game based on the popular flash game 'Awesome Tanks' made with the LibGDX library for cross-platform games in Java. The project was started in late 2015 but it was never completed. Now that I have time I decided to include the proper modifications to make it enjoyable.
